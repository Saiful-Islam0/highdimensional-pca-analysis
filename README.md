# 📈 PCA Analysis — Feature Reduction & Visualization

**Notebook:** `Bigdata.ipynb`

## Summary
This document presents Principal Component Analysis (PCA) visualizations generated from the dataset.  
PCA helps reduce dimensionality while preserving the maximum possible variance.  
The following figures illustrate 2D PCA projections and the cumulative variance explained by principal components.

## Notes
- PCA is useful for visualizing high‑dimensional data in 2D.  
- Sampling helps reduce noise and computational cost.  
- Replace/update images anytime; keep the same filenames for working README links.
